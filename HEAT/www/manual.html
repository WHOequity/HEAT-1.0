<h3><a id="1. Background" name="1. Background"></a>1. Background</h3>

<p>In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era, the world has committed to “leave no-one behind.” This requires a continuing focus on equity, reflected across multiple SDG goals and targets. Health inequality monitoring is critical to understand many aspects of who is being left behind (and where): it can identify differences in health indicators between different population subgroups. This is essential for the development of equity-oriented interventions, especially those on the path to universal health coverage. It can serve as the basis for the design and re-orientation of rights-based, gender-responsive and equitable health systems.</p>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) allows you to assess within-country health inequalities across countries. You can use the built-in <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en" target="_blank">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a> (2015 update) to explore inequalities in one country of interest and compare inequalities in that country with the situation in other countries. Disaggregated data and summary measures of inequality are presented in a variety of interactive ways, including tables and graphs.</p>

<p>For more information about the data displayed in HEAT, please refer to the technical notes.</p>

<p>The Home page provides an introduction to HEAT. From here, you can go on to explore inequality in a selected country of interest (<em>Explore Inequality</em> tab) and to compare the situation in a country of interest with the situation in other countries (<em>Compare Inequality</em> tab).</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top" style="text-align: right;">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="3.2 Explore Inequality" name="3.2 Explore Inequality"></a>3.2 Explore Inequality</h3>

<p>Under <strong>Explore Inequality</strong>, you can assess the situation within a country of interest. Inequalities can be explored using disaggregated data in tables (<em>Disaggregated data (tables)</em> tab) and graphs (<em>Disaggregated data (graphs) </em>tab) as well as using summary measures of inequality in tables (<em>Summary measures (tables) </em>tab) and graphs (<em>Summary measures (graphs) </em>tab). Note: multiple countries may not be viewed at a single time in the Explore Inequality tab, as the intent of HEAT is to focus on within-country inequalities. Benchmarking may be done, however, using the Compare Inequality tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tips for exploring inequality</strong></p>

<p>Whether looking at disaggregated data or summary measures in table or graph form, it is recommended to start exploring inequality by selecting one health indicator and one dimension of inequality at a time &ndash; rather than selecting multiple health indicators and multiple dimensions of inequality.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to toggle between graph and table views to see what values are being represented (in graph view) and what population share has been reflected graphically (in table view).</p>

<p>It is not recommended to visualize favourable health intervention and adverse health outcome indicators together on one graph. The interpretation of these is different: for favourable health interventions, a high value is desirable (meaning high coverage), while for adverse health outcomes, a low value is preferred (meaning low burden).</p>

<p>When looking at multiple indicators together on one graph, it may be difficult to assess the situation correctly if there is a large difference in health levels between the indicators. For example, when looking at two health intervention indicators, one with high coverage and one with low coverage, they will both be visualized on the same scale covering a large range of values. This may make it difficult to discover smaller variations in coverage for each indicator. In situations like this, it may be a good idea to look at each indicator individually before visualizing them together on one graph.</p>

<p>It is not recommended to compare subnational regional inequality over time if the number of subnational regions differs from one time to another.</p>
