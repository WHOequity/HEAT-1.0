<h3><a id="1. Introduction" name="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT) enables the assessment of within-country inequalities, i.e. inequalities that exist between population subgroups within a country, based on disaggregated data and summary measures of inequality. Disaggregated data show the level of health by population subgroup of a given dimension of inequality. Summary measures build on disaggregated data and present the degree of inequality across multiple population subgroups in a single numerical figure. These technical notes provide information about the disaggregated data (section 2) and the summary measures (section 3) presented in HEAT.</p>

<h3><a id="2. Disaggregated data" name="2. Disaggregated data"></a>2. Disaggregated data</h3>

<p>HEAT enables the assessment of inequalities using disaggregated data, i.e. data broken down by population subgroups, from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en" target="_blank">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a> (2015 update). The database currently contains over 30 reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) indicators, disaggregated by five dimensions of inequality. Data are based on re-analysis of nearly 250 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in 94 countries between 1993 and 2013. For almost three quarters of the countries, data are available for at least two time points (i.e. multiple rounds of data exist). A full list of study countries, with corresponding ISO3 country codes and information about survey source(s) and year(s) is given in Supplementary table 1 in the pdf version of the technical notes, which can be accessed <a href="Technical_notes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Micro-level DHS and MICS data were analysed by the International Center for Equity in Health based in the Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil. Survey design specifications were taken into consideration during the analysis. The same methods of calculation for data analysis were applied across all surveys to generate comparable estimates across countries and over time. Estimates of disaggregated data are presented alongside 95% confidence intervals, and the population share of the subgroup. The population share for each indicator is the percentage of the affected population &ndash; the indicator denominator &ndash; represented by the subgroup in a given country.</p>

<h3><a id="2.1 Health indicators" name="2.1 Health indicators"></a>2.1 Health indicators</h3>

<p>Table 1 lists the RMNCH indicators currently available in the WHO Health Equity Monitor database. Detailed information about the criteria used to calculate the numerator and denominator values for each indicator are available in the indicator compendium or in the WHO Indicator and Measurement Registry, under the topic Health Equity Monitor (<a href="http://www.who.int/gho/indicator_registry/en/" target="_blank">www.who.int/gho/indicator_registry/en/</a>).</p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">*Note that the indicators &ldquo;Births by caesarean section (in the two or three years preceding the survey)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Births by caesarean section (in the five years preceding the survey)&rdquo; are treated as favourable health intervention indicators, even though the maximum level may not be the most desirable situation (as is the case for other favourable health intervention indicators, such as full immunization coverage).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12px;">**Note that the indicators &ldquo;Adolescent fertility rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Total fertility rate&rdquo; are treated as adverse health outcome indicators, even though the minimum level may not be the most desirable situation (as is the case for other adverse outcome indicators, such as infant mortality rate).</span></p>

<p>As indicated in table 1, health indicators can be divided into favourable and adverse health indicators. Favourable health indicators measure desirable health events that are promoted through public health action. They include health intervention indicators, such as antenatal care coverage, and desirable health outcome indicators, such as life expectancy. For these indicators, the ultimate goal is to achieve a maximum level, either in health intervention coverage or health outcome (for example, complete coverage of antenatal care or the highest possible life expectancy). Adverse health indicators, on the other hand, measure undesirable events, that are to be reduced or eliminated through public health action. They include undesirable health outcome indicators, such as stunting prevalence in children aged less than five years or under-five mortality rate. Here, the ultimate goal is to achieve a minimum level in health outcome (for example, a stunting prevalence or mortality rate of zero).</p>

<p>In the WHO Health Equity Monitor database, all health intervention indicators are favourable health indicators and all health outcome indicators are adverse health indicators. This differentiation is important as the type of indicator has implications for the calculation of summary measures (see section 2).</p>

<h3><a id="2.2 Dimensions of inequality" name="2.2 Dimensions of inequality"></a>2.2&nbsp;Dimensions of inequality</h3>

<p>Health indicators from the WHO Health Equity Monitor database were disaggregated by five dimensions of inequality: economic status, education, place of residence, subnational region and child&rsquo;s sex (where applicable).</p>

<p><strong>Economic status</strong> was determined using a wealth index. Country-specific indices were based on owning selected assets and having access to certain services, and constructed using principal component analysis. Within each country the index was divided into quintiles of households, thereby creating five equal subgroups that each account for 20% of the population. Note that certain indicators have denominator criteria that do not include all households and/or are more likely to include households from a specific quintile; thus the quintile share of the population for a given indicator may not equal 20%. For example, there are often more live births reported by the poorest quintile than the richest quintile, resulting in the poorest quintile representing a larger share of the population for indicators such as the coverage of births attended by skilled health personnel.</p>

<p><strong>Education</strong> refers to the highest level of schooling attained by the woman (or the mother, in the case of newborn and child health interventions, child malnutrition and child mortality): no education, primary school, or secondary school or higher. These levels reflect the highest level of schooling ever attended by the woman.</p>

<p>For <strong>place of residence</strong> and <strong>subnational region</strong>, country-specific criteria for place of residence and subnational region were applied.</p>

<p>Table 2 lists the five dimensions of inequality available in the WHO Health Equity Monitor database along with their basic characteristics.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, dimensions of inequality can be divided into dimensions that compare the situation in two population subgroups (e.g. girls and boys) versus dimensions that look at the situation in more than two population subgroups (e.g. economic status quintiles).</p>

<p>In the case of dimensions with more than two population subgroups it is possible to differentiate between dimensions with ordered subgroups and non-ordered subgroups. Ordered subgroups have an inherent positioning and can be ranked. For example, education has an inherent ordering of subgroups in the sense that those with less education unequivocally have <em>less</em> of something compared to those with more education. Non-ordered subgroups, by contrast, are not based on criteria that can be logically ranked. Subnational regions are an example of non-ordered groupings.</p>

<p>These characteristics (number of subgroups and ordered vs. non-ordered subgroups) are important as they impact on the calculation of summary measures (see section 2).</p>

<h3><a id="3. Summary measures" name="3. Summary measures"></a>3. Summary measures</h3>

<p>HEAT enables the assessment of inequalities using multiple summary measures of inequality. Summary measures are calculated based on disaggregated data from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HE-1540?lang=en" target="_blank">WHO Health Equity Monitor database</a> (2015 update), combining estimates of a given health indicator for two or more subgroups into a single numerical figure. Table 3 lists the 15 summary measures currently available in HEAT along with their basic characteristics.</p>

<p>As indicated in table 3, summary measures of inequality can be divided into absolute measures and relative measures. For a given health indicator, absolute inequality measures indicate the magnitude of difference in health between subgroups. They retain the same unit as the health indicator.<a href="#Footnote 1">[1]</a> Relative inequality measures, on the other hand, show proportional differences in health among subgroups and have no unit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is possible to differentiate between simple and complex measures of inequality. Simple measures make pairwise comparisons between two subgroups, such as the most and least wealthy. They can be calculated for all health indicators and dimensions of inequality. The characteristics of the indicator and dimension determine which two subgroups are compared to assess inequality. Contrary to simple measures, complex measures make use of data from all subgroups to assess inequality. They can be calculated for all health indicators, but they can only be calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups.<a href="#Footnote 2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Complex measures can further be divided into ordered complex measures and non-ordered complex measures of inequality. Ordered measures can only be calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. Here, the calculation is also influenced by the type of indicator (favourable vs. adverse). Non-ordered measures are only calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering.<a href="#Footnote 3">[3]</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, summary measures may be weighted or unweighted. Weighted measures take into account the population size of each subgroup, while unweighted measures treat each subgroup as equally sized. Importantly, simple measures are always unweighted and complex measures may be weighted or unweighted.</p>

<p>The following sections give further information about the definition, calculation and interpretation of each summary measure of inequality. An overview of the formulae and characteristics is provided in Supplementary table 2 in the pdf version of the technical notes, which can be accessed <a href="Technical_notes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Further information about summary measures of inequality can be found in the <em>Handbook on health inequality monitoring: with a special focus on low- and middle-income countries</em>.<a href="#Footnote 4">[4]</a></p>

<h3><a id="3.1 Absolute measures" name="3.1 Absolute measures"></a>3.1 Absolute measures</h3>

<h4><a id="3.1.1 Absolute concentration index" name="3.1.1 Absolute concentration index"></a>3.1.1 Absolute concentration index</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The absolute concentration index (ACI) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the health gradient across multiple subgroups with natural ordering, on an absolute scale. It indicates the extent to which a health indicator is concentrated among the disadvantaged or the advantaged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>To calculate ACI, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank zero or 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup (at rank 1). Based on this ranking, ACI can be calculated as:</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ACI = &sum; p<sub>j </sub>(2X<sub>j</sub> - 1) y<sub>j</sub>,</p>

<p>where y<sub>j</sub> indicates the estimate for subgroup j, p<sub>j</sub> the population share of subgroup j and X<sub>j </sub>the relative rank of subgroup j, which is defined as: X<sub>j</sub> = &sum; p<sub>j</sub> - 0.5p<sub>j</sub>.</p>

<p>ACI is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, ACI takes the value zero. Positive values indicate a concentration of the health indicator among the advantaged, while negative values indicate a concentration of the health indicator among the disadvantaged. The larger the absolute value of ACI, the higher the level of inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.2 Between-group variance" name="3.1.2 Between-group variance"></a>3.1.2 Between-group variance</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The between-group variance (BGV) is a complex measure of inequality that takes into account the population share of each subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>BGV is calculated as the weighted sum of squared differences between the subgroup estimates y<sub>j</sub> and the national average &mu;. Squared differences are weighted by each subgroup&rsquo;s population share p<sub>j</sub>:</p>

<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BGV = &sum; p<sub>j</sub> (y<sub>j</sub> - &mu;)<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>BGV is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>BGV takes only positive values with larger values indicating higher levels of inequality. BGV is zero if there is no inequality. BGV is more sensitive to outlier estimates as it gives more weight to the estimates that are further from the national average.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.3 Difference" name="3.1.3 Difference"></a>3.1.3 Difference</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The difference (D) is a simple measure of inequality that shows the absolute inequality between two subgroups, without taking into consideration their population share.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>D is calculated as the difference between two subgroups. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering (e.g. education), the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged subgroups are compared, while for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering (e.g. subnational region), the subgroups with the highest and lowest estimates are used:</p>

<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D = y<sub>max</sub> - y<sub>min</sub>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;depends on the type of health indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which D is calculated.<a href="#Footnote 5">[5]</a> For place of residence, D is calculated as the difference between urban and rural areas in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and as the difference between rural and urban areas in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For sex, D is calculated as the difference between females and males in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and as the difference between males and females in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-advantaged subgroup and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;to the most-disadvantaged subgroup in the case of favourable health intervention indicators, whereas y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-disadvantaged subgroup and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;to the most-advantaged subgroup in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering, the lowest estimate is subtracted from the highest estimate, regardless of the health indicator type.</p>

<p>D is calculated for all dimensions of inequality. In the case of dimensions with two subgroups or in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering, D is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. In the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering, D is missing if the estimates for the most-advantaged and/or most-disadvantaged subgroup are missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, D takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable health intervention indicators, positive values indicate higher coverage in the advantaged subgroups and negative values indicate higher coverage in the disadvantaged subgroups. For adverse health outcome indicators, positive values indicate a higher concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged and negative values indicate a higher concentration among the advantaged.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.4 Mean difference from best performing subgroup" name="3.1.4 Mean difference from best performing subgroup"></a>3.1.4 Mean difference from best performing subgroup</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The mean difference from best performing subgroup (MDB) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the difference between each subgroup and the best performing subgroup, on average.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>MDB is calculated as the weighted sum of absolute differences between the subgroup estimates y<sub>j</sub> and the estimate for the reference group y<sub>ref</sub>. Absolute differences are weighted by each subgroup&rsquo;s population share p<sub>j</sub>:</p>

<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MDB = &sum; p<sub>j</sub> |y<sub>j</sub> - y<sub>ref</sub> |.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of the reference subgroup y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;depends on the type of health indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which MDB is calculated. For place of residence, urban is selected as the reference group, regardless of the health indicator type. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering (e.g. education), y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-advantaged subgroup, regardless of the health indicator type. For sex and for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering (e.g. subnational region), y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;refers to the subgroup with the highest estimate in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and to the subgroup with the lowest estimate in the case of adverse health outcome indicators.</p>

<p>MDB is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the analytic 95% confidence intervals for MDB are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>MDB takes only positive values with larger values indicating higher levels of inequality. MDB is zero if there is no inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.5 Mean difference from mean" name="3.1.5 Mean difference from mean"></a>3.1.5 Mean difference from mean</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The mean difference from mean (MDM) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the difference between each subgroup and the national level, on average. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>MDM is calculated as the weighted sum of absolute differences between the subgroup estimates y<sub>j</sub> and the national average &mu;. Absolute differences are weighted by each subgroup&rsquo;s population share p<sub>j</sub>:</p>

<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MDM = &sum; p<sub>j</sub> |y<sub>j</sub> - &mu;|.</p>

<p>MDM is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the analytic 95% confidence intervals for MDM are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>MDM takes only positive values with larger values indicating higher levels of inequality. MDM is zero if there is no inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.6 Population attributable risk" name="3.1.6 Population attributable risk"></a>3.1.6 Population attributable risk</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The population attributable risk (PAR) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the potential for improvement in the national level of a health indicator that could be achieved if all subgroups had the same level of health as a reference subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>PAR is calculated as the difference between the estimate for the reference subgroup y<sub>ref</sub> and the national average &mu; :</p>

<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PAR = y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp; - &mu;.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of the reference subgroup y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;depends on the type of health indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which PAR is calculated. For place of residence, urban is selected as the reference group, regardless of the health indicator type. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering (e.g. education), y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-advantaged subgroup, regardless of the health indicator type. For sex and for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering (e.g. subnational region), y<sub>ref</sub>&nbsp;refers to the subgroup with the highest estimate in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and to the subgroup with the lowest estimate in the case of adverse health outcome indicators.</p>

<p>PAR is calculated for all dimensions. In the case of place of residence and in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering, PAR is missing if the estimate for the reference subgroup is missing. In the case of sex and in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering, PAR is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>PAR takes positive values for favourable health intervention indicators and negative values for adverse health outcome indicators. The larger the absolute value of PAR, the higher the level of inequality. PAR is zero if no further improvement can be achieved, i.e. if all subgroups have reached the same level of health as the reference group.</p>

<h4><a id="3.1.7 Slope index of inequality" name="3.1.7 Slope index of inequality"></a>3.1.7 Slope index of inequality</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The slope index of inequality (SII) is a complex measure of inequality that represents the absolute difference in predicted values of a health indicator between the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged (or vice versa for adverse health outcome indicators), while taking into consideration all the other subgroups &ndash; using an appropriate regression model.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>To calculate SII, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank zero or 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup (at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional distribution of the population within each subgroup. The population of each subgroup is then considered in terms of its range in the cumulative population distribution, and the midpoint of this range. Then, the health indicator of interest is regressed against this midpoint value using a generalized linear model with logit link, and the predicted values of the health indicator are calculated for the two extremes (rank 1 and rank 0).</p>

<p>For favourable health intervention indicators, the difference between the predicted values at rank 1 (v<sub>1</sub>) and rank 0 (v<sub>0</sub>) (covering the entire distribution) generates the SII value:</p>

<p>(7a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SII =&nbsp;v<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>-&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For adverse health outcome indicators, the calculation is reversed and the SII value is calculated as the difference between the predicted values at rank 0 (v<sub>0</sub>) and rank 1 (v<sub>1</sub>) (covering the entire distribution):</p>

<p>(7b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SII =&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub><sub>&nbsp;</sub>-&nbsp;v<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>SII is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for SII are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, SII takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable health intervention indicators, positive values indicate higher coverage in the advantaged subgroups and negative values indicate higher coverage in the disadvantaged subgroups. For adverse health outcome indicators, positive values indicate a higher concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged and negative values indicate a higher concentration among the advantaged.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.1 Index of disparity" name="3.2.1 Index of disparity"></a>3.2.1 Index of disparity</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The index of disparity (IDIS) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the proportional difference between each subgroup and the national level, on average.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>IDis is calculated as the absolute sum of differences between the subgroup estimates y_j and the national average &mu;, divided by the national average &mu;:</p>

<p>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;IDIS = 1/n * [&sum; |y<sub>j</sub> - &mu;|] / &mu; * 100,</p>

<p>where y<sub>j</sub> indicates the estimate for subgroup j, n the number of subgroups and &mu; the national average.</p>

<p>IDIS is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the analytic 95% confidence intervals for IDIS are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>IDIS takes only positive values with larger values indicating higher levels of inequality. IDIS is zero if there is no inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.2 Kunst-Mackenbach index" name="3.2.2 Kunst-Mackenbach index"></a>3.2.2 Kunst-Mackenbach index</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The Kunst-Mackenbach index (KMI) is a complex measure of inequality that represents the ratio of predicted values of a health indicator of the most-advantaged to the most-disadvantaged (or vice versa for adverse health outcome indicators), while taking into consideration all the other subgroups &ndash; using an appropriate regression model.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>To calculate KMI, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank zero or 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup (at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional distribution of the population within each subgroup. The population of each subgroup is then considered in terms of its range in the cumulative population distribution, and the midpoint of this range. Then, the health indicator of interest is regressed against this midpoint value using a generalized linear model with logit link, and the predicted values of the health indicator are calculated for the two extremes (rank 1 and rank 0).</p>

<p>For favourable health intervention indicators, the ratio of the predicted values at rank 1 (v<sub>1</sub>) to rank 0 (v<sub>0</sub>) (covering the entire distribution) generates the KMI value:</p>

<p>(9a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;KMI =&nbsp;v<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub>.</p>

<p>For adverse health outcome indicators, the calculation is reversed and the KMI value is calculated as the ratio of the predicted values at rank 0 (v<sub>0</sub>) to rank 1 (v<sub>1</sub>) (covering the entire distribution):</p>

<p>(9b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KMI =&nbsp;v<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;v<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>KMI is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for KMI are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, KMI takes the value one. It takes only positive values (larger or smaller than one). The further the value of KMI from one, the higher the level of inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.3 Mean log deviation" name="3.2.3 Mean log deviation"></a>3.2.3 Mean log deviation</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The mean log deviation (MLD) is a complex measure of inequality that takes into account the population share of each subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>MLD is calculated as the sum of differences between the natural logarithm of the share of health of each subgroup (ln(y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;)) and the population share of each subgroup (p<sub>j</sub>). MLD may be more easily interpreted when multiplied by 1000:</p>

<p>(10)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MLD = &sum; p<sub>j</sub> (-ln(y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;)) * 1000,</p>

<p>where y<sub>j</sub> indicates the estimate for subgroup j, p<sub>j</sub> the population share of subgroup j and &mu; the national average.</p>

<p>MLD is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for MLD are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, MLD takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. MLD is more sensitive to health differences further from the national average (by the use of the logarithm).</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.4 Population attributable fraction" name="3.2.4 Population attributable fraction"></a>3.2.4 Population attributable fraction</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The population attributable fraction (PAF) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the potential for improvement in the national level of a health indicator, in relative terms, that could be achieved if all subgroups had the same level of health as a reference subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>PAF is calculated by dividing the population attributable risk (PAR) by the national average &mu; and multiplying the fraction by 100:</p>

<p>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PAF = PAR / &mu; * 100.</p>

<p>PAF is calculated for all dimensions. In the case of place of residence and in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering (e.g. education), PAF is missing if the estimate for the reference subgroup is missing. In the case of sex and in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering (e.g. subnational region), PAF is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>PAF takes positive values for favourable health intervention indicators and negative values for adverse health outcome indicators. The larger the absolute value of PAF, the larger the degree of inequality. PAF is zero if no further improvement can be achieved, i.e. if all subgroups have reached the same level of health as the reference group.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.5 Ratio" name="3.2.5 Ratio"></a>3.2.5 Ratio</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The ratio (R) is a simple measure of inequality that shows the relative inequality between two subgroups, without taking into consideration their population share.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>R is calculated as the ratio of two subgroups. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering (e.g. education), the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged subgroups are compared, while for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering (e.g. subnational region), the subgroups with the highest and lowest estimates are used:</p>

<p>(12)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;R&nbsp;= y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;/&nbsp;y<sub>min</sub>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;depends on the type of health indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which R is calculated.<a href="#Footnote 6">[6] </a>For place of residence, R is calculated as the ratio of urban to rural areas in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and as the ratio of rural to urban areas in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For sex, R is calculated as the ratio of females to males in the case of favourable health intervention indicators and as the ratio of males to females in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering, &nbsp;y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-advantaged subgroup and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;to the most-disadvantaged subgroup in the case of favourable health intervention indicators, whereas y<sub>max</sub>&nbsp;refers to the most-disadvantaged subgroup and y<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;to the most-advantaged subgroup in the case of adverse health outcome indicators. For dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering, the highest estimate is divided by the lowest estimate, regardless of the health indicator type.</p>

<p>R is calculated for all dimensions of inequality. In the case of dimensions with two subgroups or in the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering, R is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. In the case of dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering, R is missing if the estimates for the most-advantaged and/or most-disadvantaged subgroup are missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for R are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, R takes the value one. It takes only positive values (larger or smaller than 1). The further the value of R from 1, the higher the level of inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.6 Relative concentration index" name="3.2.6 Relative concentration index"></a>3.2.6 Relative concentration index</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The relative concentration index (RCI) is a complex measure of inequality that shows the health gradient across multiple subgroups with natural ordering, on a relative scale. It indicates the extent to which a health indicator is concentrated among the disadvantaged or the advantaged.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>RCI is calculated by dividing the absolute concentration index (ACI) by the national average &mu;. This fraction may be more easily interpreted when divided by 100:</p>

<p>(13)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RCI = ACI / &mu; * 100.</p>

<p>RCI is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>RCI is bounded between -1 and +1 (or -100 and +100 if multiplied by 100) and takes the value zero if there is no inequality. Positive values indicate a concentration of the health indicator among the advantaged, while negative values indicate a concentration of the health indicator among the disadvantaged. The greater the absolute value of RCI, the higher the level of inequality.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.7 Relative index of inequality" name="3.2.7 Relative index of inequality"></a>3.2.7 Relative index of inequality</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The relative index of inequality (RII) is a complex measure of inequality that represents the relative difference (proportional to the national level) in predicted values of health indicator between the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged, while taking into consideration all the other subgroups &ndash; using an appropriate regression model.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>RII is calculated by dividing the slope index of inequality (SII) by the national average &mu;:</p>

<p>(14) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;RII = SII / &mu;.</p>

<p>RII is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have a natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for RII are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, RII takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable health intervention indicators, positive values indicate higher coverage in the advantaged subgroups and negative values indicate higher coverage in the disadvantaged subgroups. For adverse health outcome indicators, positive values indicate a higher concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged and negative values indicate a higher concentration among the advantaged.</p>

<h4><a id="3.2.8 Theil index" name="3.2.8 Theil index"></a>3.2.8 Theil index</h4>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The theil index (TI) is a complex measure of inequality that takes into account the population share of each subgroup.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>TI is calculated as the sum of products of the natural logarithm of the share of health of each subgroup (ln(y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;)), the share of health of each subgroup (y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;) and the population share of each subgroup (p<sub>j</sub>). TI may be more easily interpreted when multiplied by 1000:</p>

<p>(15) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TI = &sum; p<sub>j</sub>&nbsp;(y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;) ln(y<sub>j</sub>/&mu;)&nbsp;* 1000,</p>

<p>where y<sub>j</sub> indicates the estimate for subgroup j, p<sub>j</sub> the population share of subgroup j and &mu; the national average.</p>

<p>TI is calculated for dimensions with more than two subgroups that have no natural ordering. It is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. Note that the bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for TI are not calculated.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, TI takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. TI is more sensitive to health differences further from the national average (by the use of the logarithm).</p>
