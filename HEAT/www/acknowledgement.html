Inputs to the conceptualization were provided by Daniel D Reidpath (Monash University, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia) and Zev Ross (ZevRoss Spatial Analysis, Ithaca, USA). Daniel D Reidpath, Kridaraan Komahan (Monash University, Bandar Sunway, Malaysia) and Mark R Diamond, (University of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia) developed the prototype. The final application was developed by ZevRoss Spatial Analysis.</p>

<p>Sam Harper (McGill University, Montreal, Canada), Daniel D Reidpath and Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor provided the formulas and offered technical advice for the calculation of summary measures. Devaki Nambiar (Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, India) and Anne Schlotheuber prepared the user manual and technical notes. Guidance and technical support were provided by Phillipe Boucher, Laurent Constantin, Nicolas Jimenez, Liliana Pievaroli (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) and Steve Moore.
